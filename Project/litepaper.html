                  <h2>What is Protectorate?</h2>
                  <p class="p">Protectorate is an innovative protocol designed to generate deep, sustainable liquidity for both NFTs and NFT financialization (NFTfi) protocols that have been developed to address the issues surrounding NFT liquidity. Functioning as a yield aggregation platform or a liquidity router, Protectorate aims to deliver the highest yield possible by deploying the assets deposited into a variety of strategies across NFTfi protocols.</p>  
                </div>
                <div class="paradiv">
                    <p class="p">The platform enables seamless liquidity provision for any NFT collection through a diverse range of partner NFTfi protocols, eliminating the cost, risk, and complexity associated with liquidity mining methods. Positioned as a "layer above" marketplaces, money markets, NFT AMMs, and other NFTfi protocols, Protectorate streamlines the provisioning process.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paradiv">
                    <p class="p">As it continues to develop, Protectorate strives to be truly cross-chain by deploying its systems wherever opportunities arise to enhance NFT financial infrastructure. Regardless of the network, Protectorate Protocol aspires to become the go-to hub for NFT liquidity.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>NFT Liquidity Today</h2>   
                </div>
                <div class="paradiv">
                    <p class="p">The current state of liquidity for NFTs is characterized by extremely fragmented, unpredictable, and unsustainable sources. Developers of new projects often face substantial costs as they pursue temporary liquidity solutions through unsustainable hype tactics, which resembled the hyperinflationary token incentive schemes used by early DeFi protocols to attract users, who, unsurprisingly, were not retained.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paradiv">
                    <p class="p">Relying on whales to provide liquidity leads to a continuous state of uncertainty and gatekeeping. Insufficient liquidity consequently results in poor pricing and volatility, negatively affecting collections and collectors who seek deep liquidity for their holdings. Additionally, it impacts marketplaces striving to provide the best possible pricing and liquidity.</p>

                <p class="p">Protectorate enables users to provide liquidity, and the platform determines where that liquidity is deployed with the goal of allocating it to the highest-yielding strategies across NFTfi.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="paradiv">

            <div class="paradiv">
              <p  class="p">PRTC (Native token) will initially be used for revenue sharing, and eventually governance. In the future, Protectorate may utilize its own liquidity to be provided on-demand for collections it believes may generate significant yield.</p>  
            </div>
            <div class="paradiv">
                <p class="p">The protocol captures value by providing liquidity across the NFTfi space. Over time, Protectorate will build a strong reserve of various assets that can be safely deployed to continuously generate yield, which will be shared among liquidity providers, the protocol, and xPRTC stakers.</p>

            <div class="paradiv">

            <h2>Simplifying NFT Liquidity Provision at Scale</h2>
            </div>
    
        <div class="paradiv">
          <p class="p ">Determining which collection to provide liquidity for, and on which platform can be an overwhelming task for the average collector. Most users in the NFT space are not entirely familiar with the intricacies of financializing NFTs, let alone understanding the backend operations, such as the exact strategies and the infrastructure these strategies interact with. Protectorate aims to simplify the experience of providing liquidity, making it easy and seamless for users of all types (retail or institutional) to access the highest possible yield in the NFTfi space.</p>

        <h2>Deepening On-Chain Liquidity for NFTs</h2>
        </div>

    <div class="paradiv">
      <p class="p ">NFTs have long been known as an illiquid asset class. Before the advent  of NFT AMM’s, most NFT liquidity was found through offers placed on off-chain orderbook marketplaces. With the emergence of various NFT financialization protocols, Protectorate aims to be a dependable source of on-chain liquidity for these protocols, incentivizing capital utilization around NFTs in novel ways. This generates appealing yields for NFT collectors and traders, enhancing the NFTfi experience. Users who interact with protocols that receive liquidity from Protectorate will benefit from significantly improved liquidity, offering deep ETH liquidity and, eventually, NFT inventory.</p>

    <div class="ParaQues">
        <h2>Target Users</h2>
        </div>

    <div class="paradiv">
      <p class="p ">Any NFT trader, collector, DAO, or institution can potentially benefit from using Protectorate. Today, every kind of participant in the NFT space is providing liquidity to a collection or protocol in some capacity, whether through pools on NFT AMM’s, placing collection offers on secondary marketplaces and aggregators, or activating capital (borrowing and lending) on NFT money markets. Protectorate aims to simplify and optimize the process of providing liquidity, making it attractive for a wide range of users within the NFT ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    </div>

<div class="paradiv">
  <p class="p ">The goal of Protectorate Protocol is to bring an element of cohesion across the NFTfi landscape. In the early stages of the NFT boom, trading became fragmented as various marketplaces competed for attention. This fragmentation created a vicious cycle for NFTs, ultimately leading to the birth of the "illiquid JPEG" meme.</p>
  
   
</div>
<div class="paradiv">
    <p class="p ">As demand for NFT liquidity is skyrocketing, mercenary liquidity can severely damage collections as farmers lose interest and move on to the next best opportunity. Protectorate aims to act as a reliable source of liquidity for NFTs across various verticals, starting with its money market partners and eventually expanding its horizons.</p>
    
     
  </div>
  <div class="paradiv">
    <p class="p ">By offering a stable and trustworthy platform for NFT liquidity, Protectorate Protocol seeks to address the issue of fragmentation and contribute positively to the NFT ecosystem, making it more accessible, sustainable, and valuable for all participants.</p>
